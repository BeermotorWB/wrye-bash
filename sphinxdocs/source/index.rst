Prerequisites
-------------

Like any other complex piece of software, Wrye Bash requires other software in order to function properly.

Here is what you'll need:

  * A game to manage (currently Oblivion or Skyrim)
  * `Python 2.7 <http://www.python.org/>`_ (latest 2.7 is recommended)
  * `wxPython 2.8.12.1 Unicode <http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/2.8.12.1/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.12.1-py27.exe>`_ (do **not** get a newer version)
  * `pywin32 build 218 or newer <https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/>`_ for your Python
  * `comtypes 0.6.2 or later <https://sourceforge.net/projects/comtypes/files/comtypes/>`_ for your Python
  * `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ for building the docs/apidocs/otherdocs and of course the wrye-bash python source code.
